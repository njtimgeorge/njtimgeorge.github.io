# Why I Started This Blog

I have embarked on 2 courses of study: software architecture in general and AWS certification in particular. In both cases, you need some hands-on experience. 

This blog will contain notes from studying and hands-on experiments with the tools
and technologies.

The intended audience for the blog is anyone learning software architecture or
studying for AWS associate software architect. I include myself in that 
audience because it will capture useful information for review.

The reason for this post is because, after two posts, I experienced scope creep 
on this blog.

# Scope Creep? On a blog?

Yep. Or study creep. 

I started with an idea: create a blog, put it in an S3 bucket, and make 
it public. After that, go on with my certification studies. Instead, I 
lost a week on blogging technologies, generating static websites,
designing a blog... I lost a week worth of training time, but learned a lot.

In that week, I got the classic signs of scope creep: lists of notes, handy links
in the browser, debugging irrelevant nonsense because, well there was a bug.

This post is my signpost to stay with what's important, both in my blog and
in my studies.
