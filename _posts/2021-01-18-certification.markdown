I am now an AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate. This took a 
lot of preparation.

Here was my process: 
1. I watched "the LinkedIN Learning course called "Prepare for the 
AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Exam (SAA-CO2). I tried not to
take notes because it can interfere with uptake. For confusing topics, I went
to the official AWS documentation.
1. I worked through "AWS Certified Solutions Architect Official Study Guide". I
have a digital copy, which I recommend and I took copious notes from this. 
This guide has sample questions and exercises. The exercises were invaluable and
mostly used the AWS free tier. I spent about $20 on the exercises over a month. 
If you're doing the exercises, look at the billing console every day! You could
save some money.

Now, for note-taking, I had a document with several sections: 
1. Missed example questions
1. Confusing example questions (including ones that had misleading wording).
1. Notes table (2 columns: subject and details)
1. Copied diagrams
1. Flash cards: eg. Default Max ec2 instances/account = 20

I would love to share it on this blog, but it's mostly cut/paste from 
sources that have copyrights.

I did almost all of the exercises in the Study Guide. It's genuine fun to 
get your hands dirty, and it helped solidify some conceptual notions.
Assigning a role to an ec2 instance so you can access a bucket 
without credentials was more fun than it should have been.

In the run-up, I re-read the giant document several times. I also went back to
the study guide and read the chapter summaries in case I missed anything. I 
re-watched videos on some subjects that had a lot of details (IAM, security).

Finally, on the day of, I relaxed before the test and took a nice walk. You're 
going to be staring at questions on a screen for 2 solid hours. Make sure your
eyes and your brain are ready!

A note on the test: it was difficult. A lot of detailed questions with very
similar answers. Take your time and don't panic. Read every question a couple of
times. You have time. Close your eyes occasionally and breathe. If you rush 
through this test, you'll probably make stupid mistakes.

Now, I have one more job to do: cleaning up my AWS account. I don't want to 
open it up in a year and try to figure out if "My First VPC" is actually 
doing something useful...
