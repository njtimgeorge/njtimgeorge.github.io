I just got certified in Azure Fundamentals.

I've been pursuing AWS certifications for a little over a year now, but it's
good to have a feel for multiple cloud providers. At work, we are expanding our 
cloud footprint. It's good to do so in a deliberate manner, but in the end 
a SaaS provider or an enterprise should leverage the strengths of multiple 
clouds.

Over time, I'll compare and contrast AWS and Azure, especially as I
learn more about Azure. One difference stands out immediately: Azure 
Active Directory vs AWS IAM. Azure fully integrates an Enterprise Identity and
Access Management system while AWS IAM focuses on administrative access. AWS 
actually recommends Active Directory for enterprise identity management.

Azure Fundamentals Certification actually has a lot of overlap with AWS 
Certified Cloud Provider. There are questions about PaaS vs SaaS and public
vs private vs hybrid clouds. 

If I had it to do over again, I would have studied for Azure 
Fundamentals immediately after AWS CCP.

I used resources in LinkedIN learning: 
"Prepare for the AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam" and [the 
official study guide.]("https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B08F5XLC3D&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_VD475WRMCJP6CQ3JAS1A")
