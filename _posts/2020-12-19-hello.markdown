This will be a working blog, partially for my own reference.

I am studying for the AWS Associate Software Architect test. I also want to 
understand more of the role of a software architect. As with many roles/titles,
many organizations bestow the title of "architect" on a productive senior developer but do not develop the role beyond that. 
What should an architect do? How is the
skillset different from developer or designer? What tools does an architect use?
I'll make some notes.
