# Blogging

From 2011-2014, I had time on my hands and decided to take up photography. I liked
the look of High Dynamic Range (HDR), and nature in general.

As I had time on my hands, I also took some solo vacations to Spain, Canada, and some more local places. 

Since the hobby was about photography, I didn't want to put a while lot of thought into blogging itself. I started a Wordpress site at wordpress.com and
started posting pictures. Eventually, I registered the domain 
wwww.byzantinegeek.com and signed up with a hosting service. Wordpress was an
easy way to start and remains a good tool for beginners.

# Blogging in 2020

There have always been blogging options: handcrafted website, Wordpress, Drupal, 
Google sites, anything with the designation Cotent Management System (CMS).

What are technical folks using for blogging these days? Wordpress is nice, but there are ads, and let's face it: security concerns. Most CMS systems are 
feature rich, but require a vigilant administrator to prevent abuse and security 
concerns. Also, public blogs attract a lot of spam.

Looking at the landscape, it looks like a lot of technical blog content is 
being published on 
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll"> 
Github pages<a>. 

Github pages allow you to maintain a static website, hosted for free on 
Github. It is relatively easy. You can blog in 
<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">
markdown</a>, which is a lightweight language which is certainly a standard 
for a lot of documentation. There are also authoring tools for markdown.

I'll begin my blogging journey with github pages.
