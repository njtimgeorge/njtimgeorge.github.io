# What Does a System Look Like?

When we're having a conversation, and we are seeking to build a 
solution, how do we communicate the design? In my previous post,
I described a blogging process. Do you have a picture in your head
for the process, or is it a set of steps like a recipe? Recipes
are easily forgotten.

[C4 is a model for visualizing software architecture.](https://c4model.com/) I highly recomment [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2-rSnhpw0g&feature=emb_logo) as an introduction.

The nice thing about C4 diagrams is that "correctness" is subjective
and the criteria is whether the diagram clearly tells a story. In 
many documentation standards in the past, the focus has been on 
completeness. Architectures evolve over time, so complete designs
must be meticulously maintained or they become outdated soon.

# Architecture for this Blog

The blog process from the previous post can by captured 
in 2 diagrams.

The context diagram shows that we have 2 personas for the blog.

The container diagram shows the interactions of github and 
github pages.

While hardly earth-shattering, they can be used to introduce the 
topic before going into the details of interaction. Said another
way, they tell a (simple) story on their own and they can lead
to further discussion.

# structurizr

These diagrams were built and exported from the [free version of
structurizr.] (https://structurizr.com/) It provides 
browser-based editors to build diagrams. Note that structurizr 
suggests that you actually generate entities, containers, 
and relationships prgrammatically. This will lend itself to
automation in the future, possibly as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
