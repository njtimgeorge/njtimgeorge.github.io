Occasionally, you should look at your career path and ask where you're 
headed. Do you want to be traveling in that direction? It's a complex 
question. You need to take into account:
- long-term financial plans
- career goals
- family needs
- personal satisfaction

No job will perfectly balance these needs. Additionally, it can be complicated
to change from your current situation. You are probably needed 
in the role that you currently have.

For me, I had the opportunity to look at my path as Engineering Manager. I
tried to visualize my course for the next five years and took the time to
talk to fellow Managers, Senior Managers, Directors, and Vice Presidents.
I am really grateful to be part of a transparent organization where we can
have honest conversations.

I've performed various roles in my long career in software engineering from
developer to project manager to scrum master and now, of course, manager. 
I've come to realize that there isn't some fixed line for leadership.
Each role for experienced technologists presents an opportunity to 
lead and mentor, whether in management or as an individual contributor.

What is the career path for managers? You move from smaller, local concerns 
of people management and everyday features to the building of organizations. 
If you are fortunate enough to be in a growing company, you can chart a course
to build an organization. It is difficult work, staffing the correct positions,
keeping people happy, and moving the business forward. 

One observation about managers in general: we tend to be stronger in one
of the two areas above:
- people management
- growing and running the business

It is very difficult to keep the balance between needs of the business and needs
of the front-line people. A popular people manager might be neglecting necessary
functions of the business. A manager focused soley on the bottom line might have
difficulty keeping their team motivated. 

So, I asked myself the question: do I want to build an technical organization or
do I want to build software solutions? Both involve working closely with other
people, but they have a very different daily/weekly/monthly cadence. Both have 
victories and frustrations. 

Why was I asking these questions? I've been trying to keep up on technology 
and I have a goal of getting a certification or two a year. This year, 
I really enjoyed getting my AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
certification. It started me down the path that I am documenting here. 

In the end, I made a simple decision: I will be happier as a Software 
Architect than as a manager. I see several years of hard but rewarding work
ahead and it sounds like fun.
